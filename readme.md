**README**

This is the repository for the main "smart" elements of my Google maps clone, which were entirely composed by me. Most of the frontend elements were developed by UC Berkeley while I provided all of the backend methods and including those that figure out what data to display to the browser.

Uploaded files are one's I created from scratch. Files that used skeleton code are not uploaded.
In addition to the files posted, I implemented methods that were responsible for rastering images and determining which data to server the front-end.


***Functionality I provided***
 - Map rastering: Given coordinates of a region and a window size, determine the correct images and resolutions to serve up.
 - Routing: Given start and end longitute and latitudes, determine the street directions for the trip. 
 - Autocomplete: Given a string, return all locations that match that string and substring.

 **Directions of Use**
  - To find a route: Double click on your desired starting location, then double click on your desired ending location.
    
  - To use autocomplete: All names begin with capital letters. Begin typing your location and after two letters are typed autocompleted entries will be displayed.
