**README**

This is the repository for the main "smart" elements of my Google maps clone, which were entirely composed by me. This is an academic project that was apart of UC Berkeley's 61B. The frontend was developed almost completely by UC Berkeley while I provided methods to allow the frontend to raster the proper images.
