**README**

This is the repository for the main "smart" elements of my Google maps clone, which were entirely composed by me. This is an academic project that was apart of UC Berkeley's 61B. Most of the frontend elements were developed by UC Berkeley while I provided methods that figure out what data to display to the browser.

Uploaded files are one's I created from scratch.

[Map App](http://mapsproj.herokuapp.com) (Using free service, so app may be slow to load)

***Functionality I provided***
 - Map rastering: Given coordinates of a region and a window size, determine the correct images and resolutions to serve up.
 - Routing: Given start and end longitute and latitudes, determine the street directions for the trip. 
 - Autocomplete: Given a string, return all locations that match that string and substring.
